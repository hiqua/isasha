## Gist

Attempt to formalize and proofs of Shannon's theorems in Isabelle, to replicate what has been done in Coq/SSReflect.

## Progress

So far, one implication out of the four has been made.

## How-to

### Parse and explore the file

Use [**Isabelle2016**](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle) to open the theory files.

### Indention

I ended up writing a small python script to avoid indenting my code by hand, it's really [hackish](https://github.com/hiqua/isadent).
